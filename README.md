# Ecocampus Passport 
The Ecocampus Passport is a cross platform mobile app which enables students to participate
within the Ecocampus initiative and aims to encourage students towards a sustainabe future. 

The main features of the app involves a badge system which students can earn through 
participation at events. Just like a passport for each event you can earn a "stamp" and 
if you collect enough stamps you are eligible to receive a reward.
